# Media Tool

This is an all-in-one media tool to encode various types of media. It can do a bunch of cool things with encoding videos, pictures, and music. It can play videos and has a queuing feature to play multiple videos one after another in sequence. It can encode videos with NVIDIA, AMD, and CPU profiles. I added the Chris Titus PowerShell script as CTT if you want to install FFmpeg easily.

It also has queuing for encoding multiple music files. It will automatically install all the pip modules needed for it to run. This is yet another experimental script I created, but I put a little more work into this one.
